# Secret-Santa-List-Creator
Having Secret Santa at the office, but trying to make it so family members don't get each other. That's exactly what this program does, Input is simple, the group of people that should not gift each other on the same line (do not use , or and please). Then the console will output who is gifting to who, that simple. This program efficiency is O(n^2).
